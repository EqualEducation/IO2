  <h1>The Activities Database</h1>
  <p>The database was originally developed as a means of resolving a dilemma in the way Equal Education approaches popular education: how do we maintain a decentralised popular education model and support the autonomy of EE members, while ensuring that a consistent thread of emancipatory ideas and politics is engaged with?</p>
  <p>To resolve this question the IETU team gathered and edited hundreds of activities, which EE members, facilitators and staff have created over the last decade, and have placed them in this activities database which is accessible to all EE members. By centralising the storage of EE materials, the database allows for a decentralisation of the direction of youth political schools and community meetings.</p>
  <p>In 2018, Equal Education put the database in the public domain, accessible to educators, grassroots social movements and activist collectives around the world. This resource makes available popular education materials on political economy, South African history, critical race theory, gender and sexuality, movement building, and other topics. It also allows for radical educators and materials developers to contribute to the database by sharing materials and resources.</p>
  <p>In addition to the activities themselves, this searchable database contains hundreds of additional resources such as readings, videos, and short games. Furthermore, the database contains several "curricula," which are groups of activities that were developed together and work well when run together.</p>
