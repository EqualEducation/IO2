  <h1>The Activities Database</h1>
  <p> The Activities Database is a project of Equal Education's Internal Education and Training Unit (IETU). </p>
  <p> The database was developed as a means of resolving a dilemma in the way Equal Education trains its members: how do we support the the autonomy of our members, facilitators, and local staff in directing the issues addressed in EE trainings while ensuring that we provide high quality content and do not unnecessarily duplicate the work of fellow comrades? </p>
  <p> To resolve this questions the IETU team gathered and edited hundreds of activities, which EE facilitators and staff have created over the last decade, and have placed them in this Activities Database which is accessible to all EE members and to the public. By centralising the storage of EE materials, the database allows for a decentralisation of the direction of youth groups and other EE trainings. </p>
  <p> In addition to the activities themselves, this searchable database contains hundreds of resources such as readings, videos, and icebreakers. While most of these resources are part of existing actvities, they can also be used to create new activities.  Furthermore, the database contains several "curricula," which are groups of activities that were developed together and work well when run together. </p>
    <p> The Activities Database will continue to evolve as the IETU team works to improve its interface and as more activities developed by the movement are added. If you have an activity or resource that you think should be part of the database or have an idea on how the online interface could be improved please share them with the IETU team by hitting the "Suggest" button above.</p>
