  <h1>About Equal Education</h1>
  <p>EE is a community and membership-based organisation. It advocates for quality and equality in the South African education system and engages in evidence-based activism for improving the nation's schools. It is a leader in youth leadership development. EE's campaigns, based on detailed research and policy analysis, are aimed at achieving quality education for all.</p>
  <p>We promote the rights to equality and education, with the firm belief that these will enable the poor and working classes to an equal opportunity in life.</p>
  <p>Education is an end in itself. Also,education helps one to understand and demand the full realisation of the rights enshrined in the Constitution. Led by young activists, EE seeks to improve the poor quality of education in South Africa by working together with communities, schools, teachers, principals, learners, parents, academics, researchers and the government. We build an understanding of the educational system, whilst drawing attention to problems faced by schools and their communities. Equipped with this knowledge, EE offers a new way for people to participate in the democratic system and bring change to education and society.</p>
